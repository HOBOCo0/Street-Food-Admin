# **Street Food**
The two apps (**Street Food Consumer** and **Street Food Admin**) are part of an integrated ecosystem. The user app allows consumers to place orders, which are then received and managed through the admin app by the restaurant staff.

These two application is developed to explore Firebase's capabilities and to create a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) as a practical learning experience.
